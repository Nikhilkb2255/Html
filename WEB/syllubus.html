The client-server concepts
</p>
<br>
<br>
‍Categories of Client-Server Computing
<br>
<br>
There are four main categories of client-server computing:

    One-Tier architecture: consists of a simple program running on a single computer without requiring access to the network. User requests don’t manage any network protocols, therefore the code is simple and the network is relieved of the extra traffic.  
    Two-Tier architecture: consists of the client, the server, and the protocol that links the two tiers. The Graphical User Interface code resides on the client host and the domain logic resides on the server host. The client-server GUI is written in high-level languages such as C++ and Java. 
    Three-Tier architecture: consists of a presentation tier, which is the User Interface layer, the application tier, which is the service layer that performs detailed processing, and the data tier, which consists of a database server that stores information.
    N-Tier architecture: divides an application into logical layers, which separate responsibilities and manage dependencies, and physical tiers, which run on separate machines, improve scalability, and add latency from the additional network communication. N-Tier architecture can be closed-layer, in which a layer can only communicate with the next layer down, or open-layer, in which a layer can communicate with any layers below it.

What is Web Application Architecture?
<br>
<br>
Any application software that runs on a web server and its responses are provided via a browser interface to the user. Unlike computer-based software programs, web applications do not run on any operating system of the device. A web application architecture defines the interaction between systems, applications, and databases components together.
<br>
Whenever a user sends a request to open a web page, the server will send the file to the browser. Afterward, it uses the files to showcase the page and the user can interact with the page. The functionality of the web application is also similar to website, but the difference lies in the code parsing.
<br>
In a web application, the code may or may not have any dedicated specifications on the response depending on the input received by the user. Due to this reason, a web app architecture comes with sub-components and external applications of the application.
<br>
In simpler terms, a web application architecture is a structural framework that determines the interaction between different web components (client and server)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Components of Web Application Architecture:
<br>
<br>
<img src="app.png" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
Web application architecture comes with two types of web application architecture: Structural components, and user interface app components.
<br>
    Structural Components:
    As the name suggests, these components make the structure of the application. These components include the client or web browser, database server, and web app server which are directly responsible for functions deciding the user interactions within the application. In the majority of cases, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are used to create these components. However, it all varies with the web app developer.
    User Interface Components:
    The other one is the user interface components that contribute to the visual interface of the app. However, unlike structural components, that do not interact with the architecture, but are limited to displaying the web page. These components include a dashboard, widget, settings, notifications, and many other visual elements that help in making the user experience better. In other words, these components are directly responsible for the UX or the web app.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Web Application Architecture Layers:
<br>
Every web application architecture is built based on a layered architecture. However, it all depends on the app scale. Large applications may have four to six layers whereas small applications may have three layers. Each layer functions independently and its components are closed. Below are the four commonest layers of web application architecture.
<br>
    Presentation Layer:
    The presentation layer aids in communication between the browser and the user interface of the application that eases the overall user interaction. Every presentation layer is created through JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and its frameworks.
    Business Layer:
    The business layer helps in processing the browser requests, performs the business logic of the requests, and shares the same back to the previous layer. This layer primarily determines the business rules of the web app.
    Data Access Layer:
    The data access layer is used to access data from XML, binary files, and other types of storage. In addition, it also helps in creating, reading, updating, and deleting operations.
    Data Service Layer:
    The final one is the data service layer which ensures data security and stores the entire data. This layer safeguards the data by separating the app business logic from the client-side.

What Are the Types of Content?
<br>
1. Blog Posts/Articles

Perhaps the most dominant form of content on the web, blog posts, and articles have a great deal to offer your audience. Detailed written content can drive lots of organic traffic to your site, while also informing consumers about your products, brand, and expertise in the field.

Long-form pieces of content allow brands to match up with popular queries and searches that are relevant to their audience by answering questions or teaching concepts.

Additionally, blog sections are golden opportunities for keyword optimization and gaining inbound links, which dramatically helps with SEO and traffic growth. These types of online content allow writers to include multiple targeted keywords, especially long-tail ones, to increase link ratings on the SERPs.

According to the latest research from HubSpot, businesses that utilize blogs in content marketing specifically are 13 times more likely to increase their ROI. Another great thing about blogging is that it is quite easy to incorporate into most websites.

Blog posts are often used to drive in organic traffic by creating content that is relevant to their audience’s common searches. For instance, Harver offers a software program for hiring and recruiting, so their blog tends to focus on articles with advice on best practices.
<br>
<br>
2. White Papers, eBooks, and Reports
<br>
White papers, eBooks, and reports allow brands to extrapolate on their topics and incorporate more details. Typically, this type of content tends to be around 3,000 to 5,000 words in length – and is commonly downloadable as PDFs.

Long-form content has proven to be abundantly valuable to businesses of all kinds. Ultimately, the goal of this type of content is to promote an in-depth level of expertise and industry knowledge.

eBooks can boost your rankings for keywords while also collecting lead information and providing valuable insight for readers.

White papers and reports may take longer than blogs to develop, but statistics indicate that they’re incredibly effective at garnering people’s attention and establishing expertise in any content marketing distribution strategy.

According to Survey, about 79 percent of B2B buyers share white papers with colleagues, and eBooks can be shared thousands of times. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Podcasts 
<br>
Podcasts weren’t a big deal a decade ago, but now, there are more than 29 million podcast episodes on the airwaves. Over half of American consumers have listened to at least one episode and 32% listen regularly.

According to this graph from Statista, it is estimated that there will be as many as 132 million podcast listeners by the year 2022!
Graph From Statista About Estimated 132 Million Podcast Listeners By The Year 2022

This form of audio has grown rapidly over the past several years, and it’s a smart idea for businesses to jump on the bandwagon.

Podcasts are an engaging, personable tactic in which you can reach users – even people who don’t enjoy reading can learn about your products and brand ideas. Podcasts allow customers to consume content more passively. For example, they can listen to a podcast while at the gym or driving, but they couldn’t read an article and do these things.

Fortunately, there are plenty of content marketing distribution software solutions and platforms available to promote your podcast.

For example, the Penguin Random House is one of the leading publishing companies in the industry – but they noticed a shift as people were more interested in audiobooks and podcasts as opposed to printed content.

They launched their own podcast called “The Penguin Podcast”.

The content shares insightful interviews with popular authors. By utilizing this popular concept, Penguin Random House was actually able to increase their revenue as their listeners agreed that they were more likely to purchase a book from the publisher after listening to an episode on the author.

For our in-house podcast, The Marketing Microscope, We primarily cater towards B2B entities by focusing on marketing subjects. However, podcasts are just as relevant to B2C organizations.

<h1 id="a4">Overview of HTTP</h1>
<br>
<center>
<img src="app.png" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
</center>
<br>
<p>
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.
<br>
<br>
Basic Features
<br>
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:
<br>
    HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.
<br>
    HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.
<br>
    HTTP is stateless: As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.
<br>
</p>
<h1 id="a5">Generation of dynamic web pages</h1>
<br>
<center>
<img src="app.png" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
</center>
<br>
<p>
A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
<br>
A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.
<br>
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server. A particular application server could offer a standardized REST style interface to offer services to the web application.[1]
<br>
DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.

<h1 id="a6">Application Servers</h1>
<br>
<center>
<img src="app.png" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
</center>
<br>
<p>
An application server is a server that hosts applications[1] or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol.[2]

An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software components available to a software developer through an application programming interface. An application server may have features such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to focus on the business logic
<br>
An application server is a program that resides on the server-side, and it’s a server programmer providing business logic behind any application. This server can be a part of the network or the distributed network.

Now, if we would like to know the purpose of a server program, it goes this way:

Ideally, server programs are used to provide their services to the client program that either resides on the same machine or lies on a network.
Working
<br>
They are basically used in a web-based
application that

has 3 tier architecture. The position at which the application server fits in is described below:
<br>
    Tier 1 – This is a GUI interface that resides at the client end and is usually a thin client (e.g. browser)<br>
    Tier 2 – This is called the middle tier, which consists of the Application Server.<br>
    Tier 3 – This is the 3rd tier which is backend servers. E.g., a Database Server.<br>

Web Security Considerations
<br>

Web Security is very important nowadays. Websites are always prone to security threats/risks. Web Security deals with the security of data over the internet/network or web or while it is being transferred to the internet. For e.g. when you are transferring data between client and server and you have to protect that data that security of data is your web security.

Hacking a Website may result in the theft of Important Customer Data, it may be the credit card information or the login details of a customer or it can be the destruction of one’s business and propagation of illegal content to the users while somebody hacks your website they can either steal the important information of the customers or they can even propagate the illegal content to your users through your website so, therefore, security considerations are needed in the context of web security.
Security Threats:
<br>
A Threat is nothing but a possible event that can damage and harm an information system. Security Threat is defined as a risk that which, can potentially harm Computer systems & organizations. Whenever an Individual or an Organization creates a website, they are vulnerable to security attacks.

Security attacks are mainly aimed at stealing altering or destroying a piece of personal and confidential information, stealing the hard drive space, and illegally accessing passwords. So whenever the website you created is vulnerable to security attacks then the attacks are going to steal your data alter your data destroy your personal information see your confidential information and also it accessing your password.
<br>
<br>
Top Web Security Threats :
<br>
Web security threats are constantly emerging and evolving, but many threats consistently appear at the top of the list of web security threats. These include:
<br>
    Cross-site scripting (XSS)<br>
    SQL Injection<br>
    Phishing<br>
    Ransomware<br>
    Code Injection<br>
    Viruses and worms<br>
    Spyware<br>
    Denial of Service<br>
